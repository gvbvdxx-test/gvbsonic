Thanks for playing this engine!
I spent a lot of time on this sonic engine.
Its worth it if you help share this very cool sonic engine I made.
I made this because other people enjoy playing my engines
and also modifying them.

99% of this code is by me.

Music creators:
Menu Music by Sonic 2 Complete Mind**** (I am not swearing today, or any day...)
Title Music by Sonic EXP / Motobug Engine devs.
Stage Complete Jingle by Sonic Worlds Delta devs.
Template Zone Act 1 Music by GMate+ Developers.
Some other music I forgot where I borrowed it from...

Sound effect creators:
MOST sound effects by SEGA themselfs.

Devs of this engine:
Macre the hedgehog - suggestions and improvements.
Gvbvdxx - engine devlopment.



Also F to pay respects to my scratch.mit.edu account.
It got banned for good...
